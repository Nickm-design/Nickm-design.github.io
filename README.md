This project reflects the learning effort throughout my first term in a Computer Science course. It shows how I take raw data from a provided database and properlly use API's to pick out exactly what I am looking for. Using this information I am then able to seperate the data into more usable data by parsing and then JQUERY to input into a JavaScript function. This allows me to put the data into a graph and help show exactly what the information is saying and recognize trends in the data or outliers and be able to explain each with ease.
